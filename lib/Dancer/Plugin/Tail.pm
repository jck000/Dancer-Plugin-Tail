Dancer::Plugin::Tail - Tail a file from Dancer

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.0001

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.0001';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dancer;
  use Dancer::Plugin::Tail;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will allow you to tail a file from within Dancer.  It's designed to be unobtrusive.  So, it is functional just by calling it from your scripts.  Add or remove entries from the configuration file to activate or deactivate files that may be viewed.  The plugin will dynamically generate a route in your application based on parameters from the configuration file.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

  plugins:
    tail:
      interval: 3000
      files:
        id1:    '/var/logs/access_log'
        id2:    '/var/logs/error_log'

You may specify the route and access to files.  The plugin will only read files so it must have read access to them.  The above configuration will generate '/showittome' as a route.  

A sample HTML page is included in the samples directory.  Use it as an example to build your own page.

    my $curr_pos = params->{curr_pos} || 0; # Start reading from here

    if ( defined $conf->{files}->{$id} ) {  # Only do it if the file is defined
      my $log_file  = $conf->{files}->{$id};

      my $output;

      open(my $IN, '<', $log_file);    # Open file for reading
      my $file_end = tell($IN);        # Figure out the end of the file

      if ( $curr_pos == 0 ) {          # Display name if first read
        $output = "$log_file\n";
      } else {
        seek( $IN, $curr_pos, 1 );     # Seek the place where we were last
        while ( my $line = <$IN> ) {   # Continue until end
          $output .= $line ;
        }
